        description: `I'm Mahnoor Irfan, currently navigating the exciting journey of being a 5th-semester Computer Science student at ITU. My academic life revolves around a deep fascination with data science, data engineering, and the ever-evolving world of AI. 
        When I’m not immersed in code or algorithms, you’ll find me engaging in community service—a cause close to my heart—where I love giving back and making a difference. On quieter days, I switch gears and dive into painting, a hobby that lets me express my creative side and recharge.
        I’m known for my friendly nature, and I truly believe in the power of collaboration and learning from others. Whether it’s brainstorming solutions to complex problems or just having a good conversation, I’m always up for connecting with people who share my enthusiasm for tech and innovation. Let's build something amazing together!`,
